This assignment offers basic Git and GitHub Workflow.
The steps that I undertook are:
1. Logging in to the GitHub account, creating a new repository, "PLPBasicGitAssignment", and initialising the repos with a README file.
2. Creating a new folder on my local machine named "PLPBasicGitAssignment" and navigating to it in Terminal.
3. Initialising a new Git repository in the local folder.
4. Linking my local repository to the Github repository created using "git remote add origin https://github.com/Developer-Linus/PLPBasicGitAssignment"
5. Creating a new file called "hello.text" within local folder, and adding text "Hello, Git!" in it.
6. Staging changes using "git add hello.txt", and commiting them using "git commit -m "Add hello.txt with a greeting"
7. Pushing committed changes to GitHub repository using "git push -u origin master"
8. Visiting my Github repository using my browser and verifying if "hello.txt" file and commit message are visible.
